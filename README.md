# Employee and Bus Stops

## Context

A company XYZ intends to provide a bus shuttle service that would help its employees commute to the office. The company is based in Mountain View and the shuttle would provide transportation for employees based in San Francisco.

The city of San Francisco has given the company a list of potential bus stops that it may use. However, the company may use no more than 10 of these bus stops for its shuttle service.

The company XYZ is asking you to come up with the **10 most efficient bus stops** that would best serve its employees. Generally speaking, these "efficient" stops would result in the least walking distances between the employees' homes and their respective bus stops. To that end, you were given the following data:
- the list of bus stops provided by the city of San Francisco, `Bus_Stops.csv`
- a list of its employees' home addresses, `Employee_Addresses.csv`

Since trying out all possible combinations of 10 bus stops would take a prohibitively long time, the boss of XYZ has told you that you may simplify the problem and come up with 10 reasonable bus stops that are probably efficient.
